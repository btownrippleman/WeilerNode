  <p>Welcome to my web page. As you can see, this page is devoted to me 
(John), entitled John Is Amazing. There are some who are not privy to 
the self-evident fact that John is amazing. These folk suffer from a 
condition known as Zeezeeabululah, otherwise known as Denial of 
John.Scientists are hard at work today devising exquisite concoctions 
known to ameliorate DOJ. Some day these folks should come around.
  </p>
  <p>Albert Ayler once said that "Music is the healing power of the 
universe", and truer words have never been spoken. Music is more than 
sound. Sometimes, it's not even sound at all. John Cage fans will know 
what I'm talking about.Music makes us feel and has the ability to evoke 
many different emotions.I have always been interested how music affects 
or changes us. I'd like to share a few examples and what kind of 
emotions these sounds evoke.
  </p>
  <p>"Healing" by Todd Rundgren is ethereal, melancholy and euphoric and
 at the same time. The sounds are honest about the hardships we all 
face, yet in the end, uplifting.
  </p>
  <p>Frank Zappa's "Don't Eat the Yellow Snow" is musically complex, and
 crudely absurd. It's good for a laugh and for those who like to count 
time signatures.
  </p>
  <p>Now let's talk about Black Sabbath. As their name might suggest, 
they must be evil and Satanic. But, o contraire. BS's music centers on 
fear of evil and the desire to make things right. Also, with a healthy 
dose of nihilism.
  </p>
  <p>Wait, I'm not done with Metal. My favorite Death Metal band of the 
month is Monstrosity. Uber-technical (this means complex, and most 
importantl, fast! What emotions do they evoke? Empowerment, also great 
to work out to. (Which I need to get back into doing!)
    )</p>
    <p>Finally, we have Black Metal. Noted for its melancholy 
atmosphere, a yearning for Pagan times, and sometimes misanthropy, I 
think it's hilarious. Much of the music itself is strangely beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>But enough about me. I want to hear what you all have to say!</p>
